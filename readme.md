## Roles (changeable as per meeting)

### Hitori :
1. **Machine Learning Part** : will train and test the ML model on the dataset
2. **Design** : Not sure but depends on what will be the future 

### Shourya Sharma :
1. Will do the data analysis part
2. Data explainablility chatbot using SHAP and LIME
3. Real time data analysis, fetch data from api and then do it, something on this line

### Shivaraj :
1. Will build the presentation and the video editting part
2. will do the frontend part

### Billu :
1. Backend and testing using Next.js

## Work Flow (changeable as per meeting) 

**Start by Data analysis and Model Training and collective planning with the process**

we will begin with choosing the dataset, and we will parallely analyse (Shourya Sharma) and report (Shivaraj) and train the ML model (Hitori), all the analysis will be in this repo, shivaraj will take it and form a beautiful report and presentation

**Plan, Design and Frontend** 

we will plan what components will be where, like say the chat section on right and and  then real time analysis graph then ML prediction page, you guys know the drill

**Backend and Final Work**
then we will build the final and test it, connect the API to fetch data and train the ML model
impliment the ML model
use the built pipeline to analysis





## File Structure

**Note:** All plans are flexible and subject to change as discussions progress.  
This is just a foundational structure.

1. **`README.md`** → Contains plans, ideas, and project structure.
2. Each project module has its own dedicated folder:
   - Data analysis
   - Frontend
   - UI/UX design
   - Backend
   - Documentation

---

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation

**Task:** Collect historical and real-time climate/environmental data.

**Recommended Data Sources:**
- [NASA Climate Data](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
- [Kaggle Climate Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=climate+change)
- [NASA POWER API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) → Global, real-time data.
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) → Current + forecasted weather.
- [NOAA Climate API](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) → Historical + live data.

**Steps:**
- Load historical datasets using **pandas**.
- Fetch live data via APIs using `requests` or `httpx`.
- Handle missing values, normalize columns, and ensure consistent formats.
- Merge static and live datasets if required.
- Split processed data into training and testing sets.

**Output:** A cleaned dataset + integrated live data pipeline ready for machine learning.

---

### 2. Model Training (Core Brain)

**Task:** Train a predictive machine learning model.

**Steps:**
- Use **Scikit-learn** (start with Linear Regression or Random Forest).
- Train using the historical dataset.
- Evaluate using metrics like **RMSE** or **MAE**.
- Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file using `joblib` or `pickle`.

**Output:**  
- Trained ML model (`.pkl` file).  
- Evaluation report with performance metrics.

---

### 3. Model Integration with Live Data

**Task:** Integrate the trained model with real-time climate APIs.

**Steps:**
1. Create a **data fetching function**:
   - Call the selected API.
   - Get JSON response with real-time data.
   - Extract required features (temperature, rainfall, CO₂ levels, etc.).
2. Preprocess the fetched data (scale, normalize, encode as required).
3. Pass processed inputs into the trained ML model.
4. Return real-time predictions.

**Output:**  
Live predictions based on current climate conditions.

---

### 4. Model Explainability (XAI Layer)

**Task:** Make the model explainable and transparent.

**Steps:**
- Use libraries like **SHAP** or **LIME**.
- Generate feature importance plots.
- Example output: CO₂ > Rainfall > Forest Cover.
- Visualize the contribution of live and static features.

**Output:**  
Interactive charts showing which factors influenced each prediction.

---

### 5. Data Visualization (Graphs, Maps, Live Updates)

**Task:** Create an interactive data visualization dashboard.

**Steps:**
- Use **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** for historical trend graphs (e.g., temperature vs. years).
- Use **Folium** or Plotly Choropleth for geographic heatmaps.
- Enable **auto-refreshing live charts** when API data updates.
- Combine historical, predicted, and real-time visuals in a single dashboard.

**Output:**  
Real-time graphs, maps, and charts.

---

### 6. Scenario Simulator (“What If” Analysis)

**Task:** Allow users to test hypothetical climate change scenarios.

**Steps:**
- Accept custom user inputs:
  - Example: “Reduce CO₂ by 15%” or “Increase forest cover by 20%”.
- Update dataset variables based on user input.
- Re-run the prediction pipeline.
- Display dynamically updated results.

**Output:**  
An interactive simulation tool for testing climate-related policy decisions.

---

### 7. Backend API (Model + Live Data Serving)

**Task:** Serve the ML model and live predictions via API.

**Technology Choice:**  
- **FastAPI** (preferred) or **Flask**.

**Steps:**
- Create an endpoint: **`/predict`**
  1. Accept inputs: location, year, and scenario adjustments.
  2. Fetch relevant live API data.
  3. Preprocess and pass inputs to the ML model.
  4. Return predictions + feature contribution metrics as JSON.

**Output:**  
A functional backend serving real-time predictions.

---

### 8. Frontend UI (Dashboard)

**Task:** Build an intuitive, interactive dashboard.

**Technology Options:**
- **Streamlit** → Quick, simple, ideal for hackathons.
- **React + Chart.js/Plotly** → More customizable, production-ready.

**Features to Include:**
- Region/city selection.
- Live prediction view.
- Historical climate trends.
- Model explainability visualization.
- “What-if” simulations.
- Real-time interactive graphs and API-based insights.

**Output:**  
A user-friendly dashboard powered by ML and live climate data.

---

### 9. Deployment (Make It Live)

**Task:** Deploy the project for judges and participants.

**Options:**
- **HuggingFace Spaces** → Best for Streamlit + ML apps.
- **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku** → Ideal for FastAPI + React setups.

**Steps:**
- Deploy frontend and backend separately (or together).
- Configure environment variables for API keys securely.
- Test live predictions before release.

**Output:**  
A fully functional, publicly accessible web app.

---

### 10. Live Prediction Flow (Final Judge Experience)

**Steps:**
1. Judge opens the dashboard.
2. Selects a region or city.
3. Application fetches latest weather/climate data via OpenWeatherMap or NASA APIs.
4. ML model predicts future climate impact instantly.
5. Dashboard displays:
   - Prediction results.
   - Feature contribution and importance charts.
   - Updated graphs and maps.
   - “What-if” simulation outcomes.
